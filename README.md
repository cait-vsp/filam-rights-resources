# Fil-Am Rights and Resouraces (CA)

Made by: Caitlin San Pedro

This is my final project for CPSC 349: Front-end Engineering.


## Main Concept

The main concept of this React project is a quick user-friendly React website which aids Filipino and Filipino American communities in California to quickly find trustworthy and credible rights and support resources. Users can search and filter a list of official links by category to access information on civic participation, housing/tenant protections, labor rights, immigration guidance, health support, and educational resources in California.
